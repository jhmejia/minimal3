### Who is John Henry Mejía?

A pretty regular dude who's just a little bit too curious. This curiosity of his brings him great joy but also great struggle - as he can rarely sit still. So he always studies something, creates something, explores the great outdoors, exercises, walks (and thinks), reads, cycles, or writes his thoughts in a little notebook that he always carries around.  

Yep, that's pretty much me. Hello! Hi! Nice to meet you :)

### What am I up to these days?

Currently I am living in Fort Worth working at Lockheed Martin Aero on the F-22. Alongside my work, I'm a coach for the [TCU Rowing Team](https://tcurowing.com) and part of the [Fort Worth Rowing Club](https://fortworthrowing.org/). 

### What was I up to in the past?

I graduated from a really cool entrepreneurial high-school called [LEAF Academy](https://www.leafacademy.eu/), that's certainly worth mentioning. In fact, go check it out now! LEAF has some amazing self-improvement programs for people of all ages and backgrounds. They are doing really cool things in Slovakia and the broader CEU region. [Here you go](https://www.leaf.sk/en/).

I then went onto getting my bachelor's education at UvA, where I graduated from [BSc Business Administration](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/bachelors/business-administration/business-administration.html) with specialization in accounting and minor in [Data Science](https://www.uva.nl/en/programmes/minors/amsterdam-data-science-minor/amsterdam-data-science-and-artificial-intelligence.html). 

### What can you find on this page?

I intend to use this tiny *"peace"* of internet for my personal thinking, reflections, learning and sharing of knowledge. Thus, you should be able to find here essays, journal entries, notes, poems and any other format I find fitting for the occasion. Hope you get a small glimpse into my brain by jumping around here. Thanks for visiting and don't hesitate to reach out if you think we have something in common! I'd love to connect with cool folks on the other side of the network. Peace ✌︎
